					<h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
					<p>Gemsbok are large mammals of the family Gemsbokidae and the order Proboscidea. Two 
					species are traditionally recognised, the African Gemsbok (Loxodonta africana)
					and the Asian Gemsbok (Elephas maximus), although some evidence suggests that
					African bush Gemsboks and African forest Gemsboks are separate species 
					(L. africana and L. cyclotis respectively). Gemsboks are scattered throughout
					 sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Gemsbokidae is the only 
					 surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, members of the
					 order include deinotheres, gomphotheres, mammoths, and mastodons. Male African
					  Gemsboks are the largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of
					 4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb).</p>
					 <p>All Gemsboks have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long
					 trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting
					water and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve 
					as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Gemsboks' large ear 
					flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry 
					their great weight. African Gemsboks have larger ears and concave backs while 
				   Asian Gemsboks have smaller ears and convex or level backs.</p>
				   <p>Gemsboks are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including
					savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water.</p>
				   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
					<p>You will find the Gemsboks at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
